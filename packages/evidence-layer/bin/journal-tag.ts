/**
 * `journal:tag <id> real|false` or `journal:tag <id> --caught yes|no`
 *
 * Fully portable, same cwd convention as `journal-report.ts`: the journal
 * belongs to whichever project is running this, resolved from `process.cwd()`
 * or `--repo`, never from this file's own location inside the shared package.
 *
 * Tagging happens at the moment of fixing, by whoever fixed it - not as a
 * separate ritual, and not reconstructed later. Reconstructing it later is
 * expensive enough that nobody will do it, which is exactly why the field
 * exists as a one-line command rather than a form.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 tagged - 1 unknown id - 2 bad usage.
